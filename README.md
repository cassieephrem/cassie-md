# Cassie Ephrem Climate Claims
__Article 1.“Rebuttal to: ‘2023 Marine Heatwaves Unprecedented and Potentially Signal a Climate Tipping Point’”__
 URL:https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/07/26/rebuttal-to-2023-marine-heatwaves-unprecedented-and-potentially-signal-a-climate-tipping-point/

Summary of the claim: The article argues that headlines claiming 2023 marine heatwaves are “unprecedented” or indicate a “signal a climate tipping point” are actually exaggerated. It also discusses how they may be politically motivated, and want to send the message across without context with scientific data.

Why it prompted me to rethink or question my current views: It made me consider the terms used in the media such as “unprecedented” or “tipping point” can be an overstatement in climate science. It made me think about what other climate claims are being misinterpreted, and when really will be the “point beyond no return”. 


Article 2. Sea Level Rise Hoax Exposed: The Disappearing Islands That Refuse to Disappear”
 URL:https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/10/06/sea-level-rise-hoax-exposed-the-disappearing-islands-that-refuse-to-disappear/

Summary of the claim: This article showcases studies that look at many small Pacific islands that have remained stable or have even grown. This article argues that the mainstream narrative about “islands disappearing” don't actually account for all the other climate change that is also contributing to island growth.

Why it prompted me to rethink or question my current views: It challenged me to think about the “sinking island” narrative in the media and made me question how other geophysical processes could be contributing to “island growth”. 


Article 3. “Satellite and Climate Model Evidence Against Substantial Manmade Climate Change (supercedes “Has the Climate Sensitivity Holy Grail Been Found?”)”
URL: https://www.drroyspencer.com/satellite-and-climate-model-evidence__trashed/
Summary: This article that was written by Dr. Roy Spencer is arguing that climate models used by the IPCC exaggerate the effects of manmade greenhouse gas emissions. He states that they misinterpret cloud behavior, which confuses cause and effect in feedback processes, and - based on his calculations - he suggests Earth’s climate is less sensitive to CO₂ and that predictions of global temperature increases are not sound predictions.
Why it prompted me to rethink or question my current views: This article made me re-evaluate the direction the world is heading towards in terms of global warming. Perhaps, there is time to develop extremely detailed policies that can combat global warming instead of the world coming up with a “plan B” when we supposedly reach that dangerously high temperature range.
Article 4. “Death Valley World Record of 134 °F Debunked in New Paper” 
 URL:https://www.drroyspencer.com/category/blogarticle/

Summary of the claim : Reports a coauthored paper questioning the validity of the historic 1913 Death Valley 134 °F observation. This article argues that some extreme record narratives could be unreliable. 

Why it prompted me to rethink or question my current views: It showed me that when looking at an individual “extreme records”, data provenance matters when constructing climate narratives especially from a time when the technology was not as approximate. 


Article 5. “Earth’s Incredible Dissolving Corals” 
 URL: https://www.co2science.org/articles/V12/N21/EDIT.php

Summary of the claim: This article criticizes another climate claim that coral reefs will stop growing and begin dissolving when atmospheric CO₂ reaches a certain point. They argue that their model assumptions about coral bleaching are unrealistic. 

Why it prompted me to rethink or question my current views: It forced me to think about how maybe researchers and media may be framing CO2 as the number 1 culprit for climate change. It also made me think about how other processes act to balance it out such as calcification. 





Evaluation of the #1 claim 

The article criticizes recent claims that the 2023 marine heatwaves were “unprecedented” and that this may signal that Earth’s climate is approaching a “tipping point.” The author emphasizes that the reporting is attempting to show urgency, using sensational phrasing that is alarming, without adequate context. This article was interesting due to the fact that it displays what is lost between scientific findings and media framing, and how that could alter policy making. Watts Up With That? is a blog that is primarily opinions instead of peer-reviewed research. That lowers its scientific authority and relevance in literature, however one can treat the claims made on this blog as commentary that, if possible, can be backed by primary sources in literature. 
In terms of accuracy, the rebuttal against the 2023 marine heatwaves warns about sensational language and highlights that single-year anomalies can be influenced by natural variability. Those are valid points. However, the rebuttal understates the magnitude and global scope of the 2023 events. Many peer-reviewed pieces of literature state that 2023 had record-breaking, statistically extreme marine heatwaves relative to the historical record. Saying that the heatwaves are simply exaggerated ignores the quantitative data collected and shown. (cite source)
In terms of use (or misuse) of context, the article harps on the argument that the news  overstates almost everything. That is a reasonable argument since people in power can control the media, but it almost sends a message that this argument is minimizing the significance of global patterns that multiple studies and the IPCC identify as increasing in frequency and severity. The scientific literature has connected the rising ocean temperature levels to more frequent and severe marine heatwaves. ScienceDirect+1


When discussing logical validity and common fallacies, the rebuttal sometimes portrays scientists as “overdramatic”, where they claim catastrophe and harp on media headlines rather than the peer-reviewed evidence. Criticizing sensational journalism is definitely somewhere to start, but by making these statements and not backing up one’s own claim it is borderline hypocritical.


Looking at the plausibility of the scientific counter-claim, the blog article’s emphasis on that there is “no evidence of unprecedented marine heat stress” is contradicted by much research showing 2023’s marine heatwave activity was most definitely extreme in intensity and spatial extent. The IPCC and recent peer-reviewed studies document increasing ocean heat extremes and link them mechanistically to anthropogenic warming. That being said, the blog’s call for careful, non-sensational communication is useful and applicable. IPCC+2ScienceDirect+2


In conclusion, The Watts Up With That rebuttal takes a stab at sensational media framing however, it oversteps when it implies that 2023 marine heatwave claim is completely unsupported. Quantitative analyses and data collection done in peer reviewed research show that these marine heatwaves were indeed extreme, while also consistent with expectations regarding anthropogenic warming (cite). All in all, one must demand precision in media reporting, but also evaluate the underlying peer-reviewed evidence as well before coming to a conclusion. 
Common themes 
Among all the pieces reviewed, it’s very noticeable that authors often twist scientific uncertainty as proof of unreliability. They use only certain examples to display their doubt without looking at long-term trends. Overall, many of the articles shown abandon the “scientific evidence” argument and instead critique the media critique, however some claims were specifically directed at certain accredited research. Logical fallacies I noticed include false analogies, straw-man framing, and hasty generalization. The strongest contrarian pieces are not necessarily those with better data — they are the clearest rhetorically and best at exploiting audience doubts about complexity and uncertainty.
